## Why LeetHub?
<p> <strong>1.</strong> Recruiters <em>want</em> to see your contributions to the Open Source community, be it through side projects, solving algorithms/data-structures, or contributing to existing OS projects.<br>
As of now, GitHub is developers' #1 portfolio. LeetHub just makes it much easier (autonomous) to keep track of progress and contributions on the largest network of engineering community, GitHub.</p>

<p> <strong>2.</strong> There's no easy way of accessing your leetcode problems in one place! <br>
Moreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from Leetcode is very time consuming. So, why not just automate it entirely without spending a SINGLE additional second on it? </p>

## Installation
1. Download all the files to a folder either by the "Download as ZIP" button or by cloning the repo.

2. Launch Safari, navigate to Safari->Preferences->Extensions.
3. If LeetHub is there, check it. 
4. Else follow these steps:

   a) Go to Safari->Preferences->Advanced
   
   b) Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
   
   c) Go back to safari menu->develop and check "Allow Unsigned Extensions.

5. click on "LeetHub" logo in the panel left to link displayer.
6. Set the required values, click "SAVE"

DONE!!
